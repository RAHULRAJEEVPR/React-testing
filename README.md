TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Test driven development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the software code . Once the tests have been written , you then write the code to ensure the tests pass
this process involves three phases

1.Create tests that verify the functionlity of a specific feature
2.write software code that will run the test successfully when re-excuted 
3.Refacor the code optimization while ensuring the tests continue to pass

Also called Red-Green testing as all test go from a red failed state to a gree passed state
